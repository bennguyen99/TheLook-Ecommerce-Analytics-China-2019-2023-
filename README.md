# TheLook-Ecommerce-Analytics-China-2019-2023
Using the TheLook Ecommerce dataset, this project analyzes China’s ecommerce performance (2019–2023) with a focus on sales growth, customer behavior, and product returns.

# Project Background
TheLook is a global online fashion retailer, established in the late 2010s, offering clothing, accessories, and lifestyle products through a B2C e-commerce model. From 2019 to 2023, the company records China as its major growth market, marked by rapid revenue expansion alongside challenges such as high return rates and fluctuating customer retention. As part of the Data Analytics team, I was tasked with analyzing sales, product categories, brands, retention, customer behaviors, and returns to generate insights that support sustainable business growth

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
