# TheLook-Ecommerce-Analytics-China-2019-2023
Using the TheLook Ecommerce dataset, this project analyzes China’s ecommerce performance (2019–2023) with a focus on sales growth, customer behavior, and product returns.

# Project Background
TheLook is a global online fashion retailer, established in the late 2010s, offering clothing, accessories, and lifestyle products through a B2C e-commerce model. From 2019 to 2023, the company records China as its major growth market, marked by rapid revenue expansion alongside challenges such as high return rates and fluctuating customer retention. 

As part of the Data Analytics team, I was tasked with analyzing sales, product categories, brands, retention, customer behaviors, and returns to generate insights that support sustainable business growth.

The Python script used to inspect, clean, and analyze the data for this report can be found here [link](https://github.com/bennguyen99/TheLook-Ecommerce-Analytics-China-2019-2023-/blob/main/TheLook-China-Analytics.ipynb).

# Executive Summary
TheLook China’s sales grew more than 25× between 2019 and 2023, with Q4 consistently contributing the largest share of annual revenue. Growth is concentrated, with nearly 80% of sales generated by only 13 of 26 categories. Returns average close to 30% and are most pronounced in major provinces and fit-sensitive products, eroding profitability and driving around 20 percentage points of the company’s 70% churn. In conclusion, the business's retention remains weak despite strong acquisition, leaving it under margin pressure and reliant on new customers to sustain growth.

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
