# TheLook-Ecommerce-Analytics-China-2019-2023
Using the TheLook Ecommerce dataset, this project analyzes China’s ecommerce performance (2019–2023) with a focus on sales growth, customer behavior, and product returns.

# Project Background
TheLook is a global online fashion retailer, established in the late 2010s, offering clothing, accessories, and lifestyle products through a B2C e-commerce model. From 2019 to 2023, the company records China as its major growth market, marked by rapid revenue expansion alongside challenges such as high return rates and fluctuating customer retention. 

As part of the Data Analytics team, I was tasked with analyzing sales, product categories, brands, retention, customer behaviors, and returns to generate insights that support sustainable business growth.

The Python script used to inspect, clean, and analyze the data for this report can be found here [link](https://github.com/bennguyen99/TheLook-Ecommerce-Analytics-China-2019-2023-/blob/main/TheLook-China-Analytics.ipynb).

# Executive Summary
TheLook China’s sales grew more than 25× between 2019 and 2023, with Q4 consistently contributing the largest share of annual revenue. Growth is concentrated, with nearly 80% of sales generated by only 13 of 26 categories. Returns average close to 30% and are most pronounced in major provinces and fit-sensitive products, eroding profitability and driving around 20 percentage points of the company’s 70% churn. 

In conclusion, the business's retention remains weak despite strong acquisitions, leaving it under margin pressure and reliant on new customers to sustain growth.

* **Market Basket Analysis**
  * Woman Bundles: *Blazers & Jackets + Maternity/Leggings* are very likely to be bought together in an order (records a lift score of 2.0)
  * Man Bundles: *Suits & Sport Coats + Socks* have a high lift score of 1.77

</p>

* **Retention**
  * The company was **effective in acquiring new customers** but **struggled to retain** them, as only 67 of 1,091 buyers made a repeat purchase after Q3 2023.
  * **Churn remains critically high *(60–85%)***, with **returns driving *20–33%*** —a major risk to stability.

### Product Returns Analysis:

 * **Average return rate:** 28.3%.

 * Categories with both high contribution and above-average return rates: *(Intimates: 7.4% - 29.13%, Jeans: 7.2% - 29.28%, Swim: 6.6% - 29.48 %, Sweaters: 6.4% - 28.78%, Outerwear & Coats: 5.4% - 29.95%, Active: 5.2% - 28.80%)*.

 * States with both high contribution and above-average return rates: *Guangdong: 15.6% - 28.9%, Beijing: 6.9% - 29.67%, Jiangsu: 5.8% - 29.85%*.

 * Speeding up delivery time is unlikely to reduce the Order Returned Rate, as these two numbers have a negative correlation of -0.503

# Recommendations:
Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the [stakeholder team] to consider the following: 

### Sales Department
* Top 13 categories = ~80% revenue → focus on top 6–8 (50–60%) for growth & sustainability.
 
* Clothing Sets, Jumpsuits & Rompers, and Socks & Hosiery are 3 categories with low revenue contribution (1% <), and they either have high return rates or low margins⟶ Discard or reduce exposure.

* Diesel, Calvin Klein, and 7 For All Mankind are climbing up ⟶ Promote as Key Brands in 2024
  
* Reassess declining brands (Carhartt & Tommy Hilfiger)

### Marketing Department
* Promote Key Categories & Key Brands during Q4 to maximize revenue.
* Boost/generate campaigns and promotions from Wednesday to Friday as sales peak on Thursday and Friday.
* Shift budget to retention flows: welcome offers, second-purchase coupons, winback.
  * Create a loyalty conversion funnel to convert “At-risk VIP” to “Loyal Customers”.
  * Target “Potential” customers with personalized campaigns.
  * “Price Sensitive”: Switch from discount to loyalty points + bundles to protect margin ⟶ promote retention

### Product Department:
* Extend product lines around sustained winners; test new variants.
  * Key Categories: Outerwear & Coats, Jeans, Sweaters, Suits & Sport Coats, Hoodies, Swim
  * Key Brands: Diesel, 7 for All Mankind, Calvin Klein, Ray Ban
* Reduce assortment to weak categories (Clothing Sets, Socks & Hosiery with high returns) to minimize refunds and protect margin.
* Develop 3–5 category bundles (e.g: Blazers+Maternity, Jackets + Leggings, Suits+Socks, Dresses + Pants, etc.)
* Focus on fit-sensitive categories (Intimates, Jeans, Swim, Sweaters, Outerwear, Active)
* Prioritize 3 key states: Guangdong, Beijing, and Jiangsu with targeted return-reduction trial programs such as better sizing info, local customer service (local CS), and faster exchanges.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Analysis restricted to China subset of TheLook dataset (2019–2023).

* Net Sales used for most analyses; Gross Sales only for annual-level overview.

* Traffic source = registration source, purchase source is located in the events table.

* Events table excluded: lack of order_id joinability prevents Customer Journey mapping.

* Missing values (e.g, city, product_name) excluded since not material to business questions.
